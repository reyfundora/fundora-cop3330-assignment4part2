Examples of real-world uses of this app include &#10;    making a grocery store list of items to be bought or a simple chore list of tasks to be &#10;    completed around the house. The possibilities are endless!&#10;   &#10;    This section will help with understanding the basic functionality and utility of the app.&#10;    Below are the various help sections with information on what to do.&#10;    &#10;    ~ File Menu ~&#10;    The file menu can be accessed at the top menu bar and yields three selections:&#10;    Open..., Save..., Close.&#10;&#10;    Open prompts the user for input as to where their text file is stored.&#10;    Save prompts the user for input as to where they want their list data stored.&#10;    Close simply exits the program. Data is not saved on close.&#10;&#10;    ~ Edit Menu ~&#10;    The edit menu can be accessed at the top menu bar and yields three selections:&#10;    All, Complete, Incomplete.&#10;    &#10;    New prompts the user for information on the item they want to add. A description of&#10;    the item and a due date will be asked for.&#10;    Menu delete will remind the user about the right click functionality inside the app. &#10;    To properly delete an item simply right click it and click the delete button.&#10;    Clear all resets the entire List View and you can start from scratch. &#10;    Data is not saved on clear all selection.&#10;&#10;    The user can also edit an item directly by double clicking on the cell. &#10;    Changes to the date and description can be made from there.&#10;&#10;    ~ View Menu ~&#10;    The edit menu can be accessed at the top menu bar and yields three selections:&#10;    New, Delete, Clear All.&#10;&#10;    View menu organizes your list items in various ways according to what is selected.&#10;    The default view is All.
